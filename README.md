# Linear and Binary algorithms in c#

## This program runs a binary search and compares it to a linear search


### First make list of numbers

### Pick a number for it to search


## Binary search

### The search will half the list

### It will take the middle number of half the list

### Return the number in the middle

### Check the number against random number

### If the random number is found end program

### If the number is not found repeat

### Once it has found the random number check how many time it toke to get the number and the time it toke to run the program


## Linear search

### Check the numbers in order starting with 1

### Check the numbers compared to the random number

### Once it has found the random number check how many time it toke to get the number and the time it toke to run the program
